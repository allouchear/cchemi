 Conformation search using the genectic algorithm
 	RunType=GAConfo
	maxGeneration (default 100)
	nChilds (default 1)
	CrossType (default Plane) cut and splice : cut by plane
	mutationType (default Local)
	popSize (default -1) : if -1 => geometries of the population read from
	the input file. if popSize > 2 : => random geometries
	nTimesGeoms (default 1) : if > 1 and popSize>2 : =>
	nTimesGeoms*popsize geometries generated, take heterogen popSize
	molecules (based on the inertia values)

 Interface to OpenBabel using obgradient and obopt (modified version of OpenBabel). One can compute frequencies (harmonic and anharmonic), 
 minimize the geometry and make MD (or MDConfo,...) simulation using mmff94, UFF and Ghemical force field. 
 New example files, including with mixed Quantum Mechanic/Semi-Empirical/Molecular Mechanics calculations
